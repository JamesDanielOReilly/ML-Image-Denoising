# Machine Learning: Inference and Image Reconstruction
A repository for the second coursework in my third year Machine Learning unit at the University of Bristol. This project focuses on machine learning and algorithmic techniques used for image reconstruction, focusing first on iterative conditional modes, followed by Gibbs sampling, variational Bayes. These techniques are analysed and compared, with an assessment of the benefits and drawbacks of each.

I received a result of 80% for this coursework. Both the final report and the python code are included, in .pdf, .py, and .ipynb files.
